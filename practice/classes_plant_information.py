'''
Given a base Plant class and a derived Flower class, write a program to create a list called my_garden. Store objects that belong to the Plant class or the Flower class in the list. Create a function called print_list(), that uses the print_info() instance methods defined in the respective classes and prints each element in my_garden. The program should read plants or flowers from input (ending with -1), add each Plant or Flower to the my_garden list, and output each element in my_garden using the print_info() function.

Note: A list can contain different data type and also different objects.

Ex. If the input is:

plant Spirea 10 
flower Hydrangea 30 false lilac 
flower Rose 6 false white
plant Mint 4
-1
the output is:

Plant Information: 
   Plant name: Spirea
   Cost: 10

Plant Information: 
   Plant name: Hydrangea
   Cost: 30
   Annual: false
   Color of flowers: lilac

Plant Information: 
   Plant name: Rose
   Cost: 6
   Annual: false
   Color of flowers: white

Plant Information: 
   Plant name: Mint
