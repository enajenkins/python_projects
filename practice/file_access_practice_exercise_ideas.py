Tasks
WGU is providing additional practice exercises for all students. The best method of learning Python is to practice. This will also help you prepare for the assessment, which requires you to write code.

Note: Replit is highly recommended for these exercises. This ensures cross-platform compatibility and removes potential file system risks from bad code.

Below is a sample exercise. You should copy the entire code snippet into your Python editor. Your code should be placed in the area that says “student code goes here” highlighted in yellow. This is inside the function. When you run this entire code snippet, there are test cases below your code. Your output should match the expected output.
'''

# Complete the function to print the first X number of characters in the given string
def printFirst(mystring, x):
    # Student code goes here
 
    # expected output: WGU
    printFirst('WGU College of IT', 3)    
    
    # expected output: WGU College
    printFirst('WGU College of IT', 11)


'''
Task 1
Complete the function to return the current working directory
'''
import os

    print(getCurrentDirectory())


'''
Task 2
Complete the function to return the directory name only from the given file name

'''
Task 3
Complete the function to return the file name part only from the given file name
'''

'''
Task 4
Complete the function to create the specified file from the given file name

    createFile("test.txt")
    print(os.path.exists("test.txt"))

'''
Task 5
Complete the function to print all files in the given directory
'''
import os

    # if using PyFiddle.io otherwise it varies
    printFiles(os.getcwd())

'''
Task 6
Complete the function to return FILE if the given path is a file or return DIRECTORY if the given path is a directory or return NEITHER is it's not a file or directory
'''
import os

# or return DIRECTORY if the given path is a directory
# or return NEITHER is it's not a file or directory
def whatIsIt(somePath):
    # Student code goes here
 
    # expected output: DIRECTORY
    print(whatIsIt(os.getcwd()))
    
    # expected output: FILE
    print(whatIsIt(os.listdir(os.getcwd())[0]))
    
    # expected output: NEITHER
    print(whatIsIt('apple.pie.123.txt'))

'''
Task 7
Complete the function to read the contents of the specified file and print the contents
'''
import os

# Complete the function to read the contents of the specified file and print the contents
def printFileContents(filename):
